Have you ever taken a road trip in the US and thought to yourself "I wonder what La Quinta means". Well, the late comedian [Mitch Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg) has joked that it's Spanish for *next to Denny's*.

If you're not familiar with these two establishments, [Denny's](https://www.dennys.com/) is a casual diner chain that is open 24 hours and [La Quinta Inn and Suites](http://www.lq.com/) is a hotel chain.

These two establishments tend to be clustered together, or at least this observation is a joke made famous by Mitch Hedberg. In this lab, we explore the validity of this joke and along the way learn some more data wrangling and tips for visualizing spatial data.

This lab was inspired by John Reiser's post in his *New Jersey geographer* blog. You can read that analysis [here](http://njgeo.org/2014/01/30/mitch-hedberg-and-gis/). Reiser's blog post focuses on scraping data from Denny's and La Quinta Inn and Suites websites using Python. In this lab, we focus on visualization and analysis of those data. However, it's worth noting that the data scraping was also done in R. Later in the course,we will discuss web scraping using R . But for now, we're focusing on the data that has already been scraped and tidied up for you.

## Getting started {.unnumbered}

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate the lab repo, which should be named something like  `lab-04-viz-sp-data`. [This link should take you to the lab](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/lab-04-viz-sp-data). Either Fork it or use the template. Then clone it in RStudio. First, open the R Markdown document `lab-04.Rmd` and Knit it. Make sure it compiles without errors. The output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.

### Packages {.unnumbered}

In this lab, we will use the **tidyverse** and **dsbox** packages. The *dsbox** package is not on CRAN yet; instead it is hosted on github. You will have to download and [install it yourself](https://github.com/rstudio-education/dsbox#installation). This piece of code should help get you started.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio-education/dsbox")
```

```{r eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

If you cannot get `dsbox` to install, you can instead download the two datasets we will be using manually [here](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/DataScience4Psych/raw/main/data/raw-data/laquinta.rda) and [here](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/DataScience4Psych/raw/main/data/raw-data/dennys.rda).

```
githubURL_1 <- "https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/DataScience4Psych/raw/main/data/raw-data/laquinta.rda"

githubURL_2 <- "https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/DataScience4Psych/raw/main/data/raw-data/dennys.rda"

load(url(githubURL_1))
load(url(githubURL_2))

```

### Project name {.unnumbered}

Currently your project is called *Untitled Project*. Update the name of your project to be "Lab 04 - Visualizing spatial data".

### Warm up {.unnumbered}

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

### YAML {.unnumbered}

Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.

### Commiting and pushing changes {.unnumbered}

- Go to the **Git** pane in your RStudio.
- View the **Diff** and confirm that you are happy with the changes.
- Add a commit message like "Update team name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.
- Click on **Push**. This action will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password.

## The data {.unnumbered}

The datasets we'll use are called `dennys` and `laquinta` from the **dsbox** package.
Note that these data were scraped from [here](https://locations.dennys.com/) and [here](https://www.lq.com/en/findandbook/hotel-listings.html), respectively.

To help with our analysis we will also use a dataset on US states:

```{r}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
```

Each observation in this dataset represents a state, including DC. Along with the name of the state we have the two-letter abbreviation and we have the geographic area of the state (in square miles).

## Exercises  {.unnumbered}

1. What are the dimensions of the Denny's dataset? (Hint: Use inline R code and functions like `nrow` and `ncol` to compose your answer.) What does each row in the dataset represent? What are the variables?

2. What are the dimensions of the La Quinta's dataset? What does each row in the dataset represent? What are the variables?

We would like to limit our analysis to Denny's and La Quinta locations in the United States.

3. Take a look at the websites that the data come from (linked above). Are there any La Quinta's locations outside of the US? If so, which countries? What about Denny's?  

4. Now take a look at the data. What would be some ways of determining whether or not either establishment has any locations outside the US using just the data (and not the websites). Don't worry about whether you know how to implement this, just brainstorm some ideas. Write down at least one as your answer, but you're welcomed to write down a few options too.

We will determine whether or not the establishment has a location outside the US using the `state` variable in the `dn` and `lq` datasets. We know exactly which states are in the US, and we have this information in the `states` data frame we loaded.

5. Find the Denny's locations that are outside the US, if any. To do so, filter the Denny's locations for observations where `state` is not in `states$abbreviation`. The code for this is given below. Note that the `%in%` operator matches the states listed in the `state` variable to those listed in `states$abbreviation`. The `!` operator means **not**. Are there any Denny's locations outside the US?

> Hint: Some of the abbreviations may not be familiar to you. Professor Google might be able to help.

> "Filter for `state`s that are not in `states$abbreviation`."

```{r}
dn %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```

6. Add a country variable to the Denny's dataset and set all observations equal to `"United States"`. Remember, you can use the `mutate` function for adding a variable. Make sure to save the result of this as `dn` again so that the stored data frame contains the new variable going forward.

> Comment: We don't need to tell R how many times to repeat the character string "United States" to fill in the data for all observations, R takes care of that automatically.

```{r}
dn %>%
  mutate(country = "United States")
```

7. Find the La Quinta locations that are outside the US, and figure out which country they are in. This might require some googling. Take notes, you will need to use this information in the next exercise.

8. Add a country variable to the La Quinta dataset. Use the `case_when` function to populate this variable. You'll need to refer to your notes from Exercise 7 about which country the non-US locations are in. Here is some starter code to get you going:

```{r eval=FALSE}
lq %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
    state %in% state.abb ~ "United States",
    state %in% c("ON", "BC") ~ "Canada",
    state == "ANT" ~ "Colombia",
    ... # fill in the rest
  ))
```

`r newthought('Going forward')` we will work with the data from the United States only. All Denny's locations are in the United States, so we don't need to worry about them. However we do need to filter the La Quinta dataset for locations in United States.

```{r}
lq <- lq %>%
  filter(country == "United States")
```

9. Which states have the most and fewest Denny's locations? What about La Quinta? Is this surprising? Why or why not?

Next, let's calculate which states have the most Denny's locations *per thousand square miles*. This requires *join*ining information from the frequency tables you created in the previous set with information from the `states` data frame.

First, we count how many observations are in each state, which will give us a data frame with two variables: `state` and `n`. Then, we join this data frame with the `states` data frame. However note that the variables in the `states` data frame that has the two-letter abbreviations is called `abbreviation`. So when we're joining the two data frames we specify that the `state` variable from the Denny's data should be matched `by` the `abbreviation` variable from the `states` data:

```{r}
dn %>%
  count(state) %>%
  inner_join(states, by = c("state" = "abbreviation"))
```

Before you move on the the next question, run the code above and take a look at the output. In the next exercise, you will need to build on this pipe.

10. Which states have the most Denny's locations per thousand square miles? What about La Quinta?

Next, we put the two datasets together into a single data frame. However before we do so, we need to add an identifier variable. We'll call this `establishment` and set the value to `"Denny's"` and `"La Quinta"` for the `dn` and `lq` data frames, respectively.

```{r}
dn <- dn %>%
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")
lq <- lq %>%
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")
```

Because the two data frames have the same columns, we can easily bind them with the `bind_rows` function:

```{r}
dn_lq <- bind_rows(dn, lq)
```

We can plot the locations of the two establishments using a scatter plot, and color the points by the establishment type. Note that the latitude is plotted on the x-axis and the longitude on the y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(dn_lq, mapping = aes(
  x = longitude,
  y = latitude,
  color = establishment
)) +
  geom_point()
```

The following two questions ask you to create visualizations. These visualizations should follow best practices you learned in class, such as informative titles, axis labels, etc. See <http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html> for help with the syntax. You can also choose different themes to change the overall look of your plots, see <http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html> for help with these.

11. Filter the data for observations in North Carolina only, and recreate the plot. You should also adjust the transparency of the points, by setting the `alpha` level, so that it's easier to see the overplotted ones. Visually, does Mitch Hedberg's joke appear to hold here?

12. Now filter the data for observations in Texas only, and recreate the plot, with an appropriate `alpha` level. Visually, does Mitch Hedberg's joke appear to hold here?

That's it for now! In the next lab, we will take a more quantitative approach to answering these questions.

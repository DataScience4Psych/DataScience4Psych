### Searching the Public Library of Science: rplos {#plos-one}

[PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/) is an open-access journal. They allow access to an impressive range of search tools, and allow you to obtain the full text of their articles. rOpenSci has a package called rplos that we can use to interact with the [PLOS API](http://api.plos.org). They have a nice tutorial on the rOpenSci website that you can see [here](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rplos_tutorial.html). First, install/load the rplos package from CRAN.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,error=TRUE}
# install.packages("rplos")
library(rplos)
```

#### Searching PLOS ONE

Let's follow along with the [`rOpenSci` tutorial](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rplos_tutorial.html) and do some searches:

```{r,error=TRUE}
searchplos(q = "Helianthus", fl = "id", limit = 5)
```

```{r,error=TRUE}
searchplos("materials_and_methods:France", fl = "title, materials_and_methods")
```

```{r,error=TRUE}
searchplos("materials_and_methods:study site", fl = "title, materials_and_methods")
```

```{r,error=TRUE}
searchplos("*:*", fl = "id")
```

Here is a list of [options for the search](http://api.plos.org/solr/search-fields/) or you can run `data(plosfields)` followed by `plosfields` in the R Console.

#### Take a highbrow look

The `highplos()` function does "highlighted searches on PLOS Journals full-text content".

```{r,error=TRUE}
highlighted <- highplos(q = "alcohol", hl.fl = "abstract", rows = 10)
```

We can then pass this output to `highbrow()`, which will open up our default browser where we can browse the highlighted fragments. When we run `highbrow(highlighted)` in our R Console this is what we see in our browser:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example rplos highlights", out.width = "100%",error=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rplos-highbrow.png")
```

#### Plots over time

We can use the `plot_throughtime()` function to visualize the results of a search over time.

```{r,error=TRUE}
plot_throughtime(terms = "phylogeny", limit = 200)
```

 Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P) course notes is a GitHub-hosted repository containing a flipped multimedia textbook for learning data science in psychology. This multimedia textbook is designed to be used in conjunction with the Data Science for Psychologists course at Wake Forest University. The course is designed to introduce students to data science principles within psychology. Initially developed for graduate students at the dawn of the pandemic, it will be available to undergraduates starting next spring (2026). The course does not require prior programming or advanced mathematical knowledge. The primary goal of DS4P is to equip students with the skills necessary for reproducible and transparent data analysis.
 
 To achieve this, the course integrates: R Programming Language for data manipulation and statistical analysis R Markdown to support literate programming by combining code, narrative, and output Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration The course notes include embedded lectures, slides, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs, all freely available online. DS4P makes extensive use of open-source materials and tools. The course materials are inspired by and build upon resources from Jenny Bryan’s STAT 545 and Happy Git with R, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Data Science in a Box. Additionally, the course benefits from open-source contributions from the broader data science and psychology communities, ensuring students engage with widely used and well-supported methodologies. By the end of DS4P, students developed a strong foundation in data science tools and methodologies, empowering them to apply these skills to psychological research and beyond

# Welcome to PSY 703 {-}

Welcome to class! This website accompanies Mason Garrison’s Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P), a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University. DS4P is designed for curious beginners. No prior experience with R, coding, or quantitative methods is assumed—just a willingness to explore data in a hands-on way. I encourage anyone who is quant-curious to work their way through these course notes. The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs. You can find the current version of the course syllabus [here][course_syllabus], along with all of the [other syllabi for my classes][syllabi]. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a [youtube playlist][pl_all].

Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P). DS4P is a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University. This website hosts the course notes.  All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a [youtube playlist][ds4p-pl-all]. You can find the current version of the course syllabus [here](https://github.com/smasongarrison/Syllabi/blob/master/syllabus_datascience.pdf), along with all of the [other syllabi for my classes]( https://github.com/smasongarrison/Syllabi).

## Mason Notes{-}
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

ds4p_status <- read_csv("data/ds4p_status.csv"
#    , col_types = cols(Module = col_factor(levels = c("0", 
#        "01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", 
#        "08", "09", "10", "11", "12", "13", 
#        "14", "15")))
)
ds4p_status$Status=round(rowMeans(ds4p_status[,2:6],na.rm = TRUE),digits = 3)
```


This website is constantly changing. This new course is active development, and approximately `r round(mean(ds4p_status$Status,na.rm = TRUE),digits = 3)*100`% done. I have made this process explicitly transparent because I want you to see how you can use R to produce some pretty neat things. Indeed, I've included the source code for this website in the class github. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool / useful resources, please add them. By the end of the semester, I would love for everyone to have contributed to the course materials. It can be as simple as adding a course request to the [wishlist](#course-wishlist). I believe that it is useful skill to be able to do. 


In terms of timing, I will have each module completed by the start of the week. In our first class, we'll decide what day of the week that will be. It is likely that I will get ahead of this deadline. You can see the current status of the course below.

### Status of course {-}


This table provides the current status of the course. It lists proportions of specific components by module. Overall it is `r round(mean(ds4p_status$Status,na.rm = TRUE),digits = 5)*100`% complete. 



```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

ds4p_status %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                #filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(ds4p_status$Module), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))

```


### Course Wishlist {-}

Although there will be hiccups and snafus along the way, one major advantage of this process is that you(!) can have a major input on what we cover. Some of these inputs have already been incorporated (such as github, Rshiny). So take advantage! Add your requests to the [markdown list below](#wish-not-yet-granted)! As I incorporate those requests, I'll move them into the [Wish Granted Section](#wish-granted).


#### Wish Granted {-}
* [Github](#installgit)
* [Rshiny](#rshiny)


#### Wish Not Yet Granted {-}

* Data Science and the Law
* Computational neuroscience

## Working with Dates

You can follow along with the slides [here][d11_types] if you would like to open them full-screen.

```{r dates-setup, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
ds4p_funyoutube <- read.csv("admin/csv/ds4p_funyoutube.csv", sep = "")
ds4p_urls <- read.csv("./admin/csv/ds4p_urls.csv")
```

```{r dates-embed-video, echo=FALSE}
# Working with Dates
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6cEDlzCBfQ" %>%
  embed_url() %>%
  use_align("center")
```

```{r dates-show-slides, echo=FALSE}
slide_url(ds4p_urls, "d11_types", "#52") %>%
  include_url(height = "400px")
```

```{r links, child="admin/md/courselinks.md"}
```

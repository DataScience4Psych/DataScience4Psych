```

## Feature engineering

* We prefer simple models when possible, but **parsimony** does not mean sacrificing accuracy (or predictive performance) in the interest of simplicity

* Variables that go into the model and how they are represented are just as critical to success of the model

* **Feature engineering** allows us to get creative with our predictors in an effort to make them more useful for our model (to increase its predictive performance)

### Same training and testing sets as before

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used
set.seed(1066)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set
email_split <- initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(email_split)
test_data <- testing(email_split)
```

### A simple approach: `mutate()`

```{r}
train_data %>%
  mutate(
    date = date(time),
    dow = wday(time),
    month = month(time)
  ) %>%
  select(time, date, dow, month) %>%
  sample_n(size = 5) # shuffle to show a variety
```

## Modeling workflow, revisited

* Create a **recipe** for feature engineering steps to be applied to the training data

* Fit the model to the training data after these steps have been applied

* Using the model estimates from the training data, predict outcomes for the test data

* Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data

## Building recipes

### Initiate a recipe

```{r initiate-recipe, results="hide"}
email_rec <- recipe(
  spam ~ ., # formula
  data = train_data # data to use for cataloguing names and types of variables
)

summary(email_rec)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(email_rec) %>% print(n = 21)
```

### Remove certain variables

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_rm(from, sent_email)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```

### Feature engineer date

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_date(time, features = c("dow", "month")) %>%
  step_rm(time)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```

### Discretize numeric variables

Proceed with major caution! And please be sure to read [MacCallum, R. C., Zhang, S., Preacher, K. J., & Rucker, D. D. (2002). On the practice of dichotomization of quantitative variables. Psychological Methods, 7, 19-40.](http://www.quantpsy.org/pubs/maccallum_zhang_preacher_rucker_2002.pdf) and play around with the demo data from Kris's website: <http://www.quantpsy.org/mzpr.htm>

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_cut(cc, attach, dollar, breaks = c(0, 1)) %>%
  step_cut(inherit, password, breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```

### Create dummy variables

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```

### Remove zero variance variables

Variables that contain only a single value

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```

### All in one place

```{r}
email_rec <- recipe(spam ~ ., data = email) %>%
  step_rm(from, sent_email) %>%
  step_date(time, features = c("dow", "month")) %>%
  step_rm(time) %>%
  step_cut(cc, attach, dollar, breaks = c(0, 1)) %>%
  step_cut(inherit, password, breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20)) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

## Building workflows

### Define model

```{r}
email_mod <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm")

email_mod
```

### Define workflow

**Workflows** bring together models and recipes so that they can be easily applied to both the training and test data.

```{r}
email_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(email_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(email_rec)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
email_wflow
```

### Fit model to training data

```{r}
email_fit <- email_wflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)
```

```{r}
tidy(email_fit) %>% print(n = 31)
```

### Make predictions for test data

```{r}
email_pred <- predict(email_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

email_pred
```

### Evaluate the performance

```{r roc}
email_pred %>%
  roc_curve(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  ) %>%
  autoplot()
```

```{r}
email_pred %>%
  roc_auc(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  )
```

## Making decisions

### Cutoff probability: 0.5

Suppose we decide to label an email as spam if the model predicts the probability of spam to be **more than 0.5**.

```{r confusion-50}
cutoff_prob <- 0.5
email_pred %>%
  mutate(
    spam      = if_else(spam == 1, "Email is spam", "Email is not spam"),
    spam_pred = if_else(.pred_1 > cutoff_prob, "Email labelled spam", "Email labelled not spam")
  ) %>%
  count(spam_pred, spam) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = spam, values_from = n) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("", "Email is not spam", "Email is spam"))
```

### Cutoff probability: 0.25

Suppose we decide to label an email as spam if the model predicts the probability of spam to be **more than 0.25**.

```{r confusion-25}
cutoff_prob <- 0.25
email_pred %>%
  mutate(
    spam      = if_else(spam == 1, "Email is spam", "Email is not spam"),
    spam_pred = if_else(.pred_1 > cutoff_prob, "Email labelled spam", "Email labelled not spam")
  ) %>%
  count(spam_pred, spam) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = spam, values_from = n) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("", "Email is not spam", "Email is spam"))
```

### Cutoff probability: 0.75

Suppose we decide to label an email as spam if the model predicts the probability of spam to be **more than 0.75**.

```{r confusion-75}
cutoff_prob <- 0.75
email_pred %>%
  mutate(
    spam      = if_else(spam == 1, "Email is spam", "Email is not spam"),
    spam_pred = if_else(.pred_1 > cutoff_prob, "Email labelled spam", "Email labelled not spam")
  ) %>%
  count(spam_pred, spam) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = spam, values_from = n) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("", "Email is not spam", "Email is spam"))
```
